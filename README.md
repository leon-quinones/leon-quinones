### Hi there, I'm Leonardo ğŸ‘‹


I'm a self-taught backend developer.
Also, I'm advancing in my software engineering degree to build large scale applications in a near future.
>"It's not just about coding; it's about understanding why you're coding something in a particular way".

I currently live in BogotÃ¡, Colombia ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡´

I like to build things with Python, Go and C# ğŸ¤–.

I have experience building software for scientific computing and near surface geophysics.
